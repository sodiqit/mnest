# Mnest

## Motivation

Usually on setup full project(cloning project, install deps, run new docker container with database) takes a lot of time. And via this package it's can be easier. 

## Prerequisite

* Installing `yarn`. Metalamp Nest js starter kit using yarn package manager. 
* Have ssh connection with private repo, where locate starter-kit. If you have [multiply](https://gist.github.com/oanhnn/80a89405ab9023894df7) instance on github, you need pass working host via argument.
  By default *mnest* use `github.com`.
